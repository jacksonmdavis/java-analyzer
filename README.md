#  The "Analyzer" App

### Check it out at [java-app.jacksonmdavis.com](http://java-app.jacksonmdavis.com)

This is an "Analyzer" app. Analyzer is in quotes because the app really doesn't do anything important. It literally only accepts one particular CSV, does some very basic analysis, and sends back some charts. I even disabled manual download/upload because who cares.

The actual purpose of the app was for me to get experience with some new technologies, particularly Java, GraalVM, and multiple Docker containers with docker-compose, so the tech stack is complete overkill. I made it over a weekend to prepare for a job interview, and decided to keep it because I love all my children equally.

I also added a status bar to show the API calls and app status, to remind us all that technology is neat, and to get comfortable with streaming responses.
